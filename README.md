# Lab 6

### ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ It is the continuation of Lab 5. You will work with the same partner ðŸ”´ðŸ”´
- ####  I have provided you with the solution and test case for Lab 5
- ####  Whatever grade you get in Lab 6, will automatically be assigned to Lab 5
### ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ *DO NOT* Start to code before the instructor Approve your algorithm, and test cases ðŸ”´ðŸ”´

Grade: EMRN 
Due: Before next lab

## `Problem`: 
You need to refactor the ATM application so that it has proper error checking and functions.

## `Purpose`: 
This lab gives you practice with:
* Designing and programming functions
* Re-using many of the other aspects of Python we've learned so far
* Testing code
* Using loops for input validation and error checking

## `Details`:
You need to refactor some example code from Lab 5 so that the following is true:
* It is now organized in functions
* If the user enters an invalid option they are prompted again, and this continues until they give a valid option
* If the user enters a negative number to deposit or withdraw, they are asked again, and this continues until they give a valid value
* If their balance becomes negative, alert the user it is negative and will be charged 5%.

## `Steps`:
We are going to practice "iterative development": focusing on one aspect of the problem first, then once that works, focusing on the rest of it.

1. Understand the problem
2. Look over the Lab6 version of the Lab5 code in your repo.
3. Determine the functions that might make sense in the code. Take at most 10 minutes planning. Refer to your function notes to help you plan!
4. Re-arrange the code into functions without adding the new error checking. Refer to your function notes to help you code!
5. Test that your code still works using the test cases you developed for Lab 5.
6. **Get feedback from the instructor on your design thus far.**
7. Design your error checking functions. Put these designs in algorithm.txt. Look back at your notes to help you do this!
8. Write your code for the new error checking functions following your algorithm and using good usability principles. Incorporate them into your previously working code.
9. Properly comment your code with intro comments, function comments, and line comments
10. Write a set of testcases in testcases.xlsx to test your new functionality (your error checking). Your test cases from Lab 5 should be sufficient for testing in general, so focus on the new ones.

## `What to Submit in GitHub:`

1. Completed `main.py` file  
2. `algorithm.md`
   1. Must contain image of your flow chart
3. An Excel file with your test cases.  
    - Edit the `test_cases.xlsx` file with Excel software 
    - If it can open then ok. Otherwise
      - Right click on `test_cases.xlsx` -> Open In -> Associated Application
4. Encrypt your files using the `keys` and `process_reflection.py`
   1. `RD1.md` -> Reflection for Drive 1
   2. `RD2.md` -> Reflection for Drive 2
   3. If you use a different key, it is considered unsubmited

**As a reminder, reflections count toward your participation grade.**

Type the Reflection INSIDE the respective Word file and addressing the following questions:

 - Objective:
   - What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?

 - Procedure:
   - What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
   - What were the Key concepts explored?

 - Results:
   - Did your results match what you expected to get? 
   - Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?
  
 - Reflection:
   - What challenges did you encounter? 
   - How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
   - Did you overcome them, and how? 
   - Any key takeaways? 
   - Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab? 
   - What was it like working with your partner?
